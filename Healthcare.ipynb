I truly understand what I am go through as I am sure many other people feel the same I do not like to feel like I am whine or complain or that I am not strong enough to deal with my problem but I feel weak every day I am in the family and friend of cancer patient group because my father was diagnose with stage 4 renal cancer the first week of january he was at my wedding in september and look great he play golf in october and november the last week of november he start to look anemic so his wife take he to the doctor they confirm cancer in january everything have happen so quick the cancer is so aggressive that it have already spread from his kidney to his liver lung and spine they would not do radiation or chemo they try he on torisel but he have such a bad reaction to it that they take he off now he have have one treatment of avastin and so far no real bad side effect except for a small rash he live so far away I go to visit he a couple of week ago and he have already lose so much weight I do not even recognize he it seem so unfair that this is happen it is all happen so quick it make I so sad and upset and I am angry that it seem like he do not even get a true fighting chance they can not do surgery and I am hope this avastin really help he is a good man\",\n          \"I am a new member reach out and willing to give back to the extend of my ability my father was recently
